Version  1.2	16 Oct 2002
--------------------------
*	Added host and port command line options to test server code

*	Added httpdAuthenticate and httpdForceAuthenticate to the API
	library to support Basic HTTP authentication.

*	NOTE : Added a timeout arg to the httpdGetConnection() api call.  
	If the arg is non-null then it is passed to select as the max
	time we are prepared to wait for a connection.  A null value
	will force it to block and a non-null value with the fields
	set to 0 will force a poll (just like select).
	httpdGetConnect() now returns -1 on error, 0 on timeout, 1 if
	a connection was accepted.

*	Added version.c and version/vendor globals to the library

*	Added api routine httpdFreeVariables() that interfaces with the
	internal code that clears the symbol table.  The table is
	automatically cleared when httpdEndRequest() is called but
	this allows the application to do it if needed.

*	Added IP Access Control List support via the httpdAddAcl(),
	httpdSetDefaultAcl() and httpdCheckAcl() API routines.  An
	ACL is constructed by specifying address block / action
	pairs where an address block is specified in CIDR notation
	(e.g. 10.1.1.0/24) and the action is either a permit or deny.


Version  1.1	15 Mar 2002

*	Added httpdAddCWildcardContent( ) API function and associated
	backend code.

*	Corrected an error in the documentation of httpdAddWildcardContent( )


Version  1.0	4 Mar 2002
