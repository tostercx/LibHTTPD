1. I get compilation about missing types

Answer: Include the header file that is shipped with this library.  It
is usually installed in /usr/local/include and is called httpd.h.  
Just add
	#include <httpd.h>

to your code and compile it with the following compiler flag

	-I /usr/local/include

-------
2. I get link errors about unresolved symbols

Answer: You are not linking against the library.  The library archive is
installed in /usr/local/lib by default.  Add the following to your link
command
	-L /usr/local/lib -lhttpd

-------
3. I can't get  the web server to bind to a particular hostname

Answer: The httpdCreate( ) function does not take a hostname, only an
IP address.  Replace the hostname with the IP Address of the host and
everything should be fine.
